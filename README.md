# Candy Crush

A simple version of Candy Crush in React, including regular candy and speical candy (stripped candy, wrapped candy, fish candy and color bomb)

It can drag, create and detonate regular candy and special candy in every match. Meanwhile, you could combine the special candy with other special candy to have a strong effect on the candy board. For example, stipped candy with stripped candy, wrapped candy with wrapped candy, and stipped candy with fish candy.

Effects for color bomb include detonation for all chosen-color & same-type candies and activation when fish candy or stripped candy triggers.
